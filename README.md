# flu_ios_design

This project is an ecommerce user interface app.
It is designed to have traditional iOS look and feel using Cupertino design.

## Getting Started

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/moses-20/flu_ios_design.git` in an empty folder.
2. Get the dependencies by running `flutter pub get`.

If you want to test the app without an iOS device, enable the beta channel of your Flutter SDK and do `flutter run -d web`.
